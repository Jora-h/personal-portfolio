      My name is Hajar, and I am a passionate junior developer soon to graduate
      from JENSEN yrkesh√∂gskola in Gothenburg, where I have been honing my
      skills in frontend development and web security. My journey to becoming a
      software developer has been diverse and enriching. With a background in
      jewelry making and geology, I bring a unique perspective to the tech
      world. As a dedicated mother and wife, I balance my family life with my
      professional ambitions, always striving to learn and grow. I am excited to
      embark on this new career path and look forward to contributing to
      innovative projects and dynamic teams.
